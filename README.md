# Cracking the Coding Interview

## 1 Arrays and Strings
1.1 [Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters What if you can not use additional data structures?](./code/1.1.cpp)  # easy

1.2 [Write code to reverse a C-Style String (C-String means that “abcd” is represented  as five characters, including the null character )](./code/1.2.cpp) # easy

1.3 [Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine An extra copy of the array is not](./code/1.3.cpp) #easy

1.4 [Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not](./code/1.4.cpp) # easy;anagrams :由颠倒字母顺序而构成的字 

1.5 [Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’](./code/1.5.cpp) # easy

1.6 [Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees Can you do this in place?](https://github.com/fishermanzhangzhen/leetcode/blob/master/Rotate_Image.cpp) done

1.7 [Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0](https://github.com/fishermanzhangzhen/leetcode/blob/master/Set_Matrix_Zeroes.cpp) done

1.8 [Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring]()
